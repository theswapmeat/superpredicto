<div class="container my-5">
  <h5 class="mb-3">Uh-oh. Youâ€™re on the support page. That canâ€™t be good.</h5>

  <p>
    If youâ€™ve made it here, something probably went wrong â€” and honestly, thatâ€™s
    impressive. SuperPredicto is almost foolproof, but youâ€™ve clearly found the
    one button I forgot to label properly.
  </p>

  <p>Donâ€™t worry though â€” I'm here to help. Probably. Eventually.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, try the classic fix:</p>
  <ul class="ps-3">
    <li>Refresh the page.</li>
    <li>Log out and back in.</li>
    <li>Blame your internet.</li>
    <li>Ask Alan (ðŸ¤£) what to do.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Still stuck? Fine.
